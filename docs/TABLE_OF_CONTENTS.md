## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Start from Exercise 1** - Each exercise builds on previous knowledge
2. **Read thoroughly** - Understand concepts before coding
3. **Experiment freely** - Modify values and see what happens
4. **Use hints sparingly** - Try solving problems yourself first
5. **Take breaks** - Complex topics need time to absorb
6. **Build something extra** - Apply concepts to your own ideas
7. **Share your work** - Show others what you've created!

## 🆘 Getting Help

- **Stuck?** Check the expandable hint sections in each exercise
- **Error?** Read the "Common Issues and Solutions" sections
- **Question?** Review the "Deep Dive" explanations
- **Still stuck?** Open an issue or ask for help
