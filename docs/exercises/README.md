# 2D DirectX 11 Beginner Exercises

Welcome! These exercises will teach you 2D graphics programming with DirectX 11, progressively building your skills from simple color changes to a complete 2D game demo.

## Prerequisites
- Basic C++ knowledge
- Understanding of the current codebase structure
- Windows development environment with DirectX 11 SDK

## How to Use These Exercises

Each exercise builds on the previous one. Start with Exercise 1 and work your way through. Each exercise includes:
- **Learning Objectives**: What you'll learn
- **Instructions**: Step-by-step guide
- **Hints**: Tips to help you succeed
- **Solution Notes**: Key concepts explained

## Exercise Overview

### Beginner Level (Understanding the Basics)

1. **[Exercise 1: Background Colors](./01-background-colors.md)** - Learn about RGB color values and the clear operation
2. **[Exercise 2: Animated Colors](./02-animated-colors.md)** - Introduce time-based animations and sine waves
3. **[Exercise 3: Your First Triangle](./03-first-triangle.md)** - Create vertex buffers and basic shaders

### Intermediate Level (Building Blocks)

4. **[Exercise 4: Drawing Rectangles](./04-rectangles.md)** - Index buffers and quad rendering
5. **[Exercise 5: Textures](./05-textures.md)** - Load and display images
6. **[Exercise 6: Transformations](./06-transformations.md)** - Translate, rotate, and scale objects

### Advanced Level (Interaction & Organization)

7. **[Exercise 7: Mouse Interaction](./07-mouse-interaction.md)** - Respond to user input
8. **[Exercise 8: Multiple Sprites](./08-multiple-sprites.md)** - Render many objects efficiently
9. **[Exercise 9: Sprite Animation](./09-sprite-animation.md)** - Animate sprites with sprite sheets
10. **[Exercise 10: 2D Camera](./10-camera.md)** - Pan and zoom your 2D world

### Final Project

**[Final Project: 2D Space Shooter](./final-project.md)** - Combine everything you've learned to create a simple space shooter game with a player ship, enemies, bullets, scrolling background, and score display.

## Tips for Success

- **Take your time**: Don't rush through the exercises
- **Experiment**: Try modifying values to see what happens
- **Debug visually**: Use different colors to verify your rendering
- **Read the documentation**: The arch.md document has valuable RAII patterns
- **Build incrementally**: Test after each small change
